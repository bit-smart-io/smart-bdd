### Syntax highlighting
Evaluate https://prismjs.com/ for syntax highlighting
1. Use prism.js and maybe https://prismjs.com/extending.html#language-definitions
2. Use javascript replace for Given/When/Then for strings, numbers etc...
3. We have this information at source token, we could generate the pre code and classes when writing. It's not that easy 
   each new line (or even token) may have to be a pre.
