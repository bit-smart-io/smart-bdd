Collaborating and or discussing this project with another human being would be awesome.

I'm in the process of creating a road map and increasing the quality of the documentation and code.

There is TODO.md with a list of tasks, it is very much work in progress.

I'm looking for more real world usages, I've love help anyone write new tests and or migrate legacy tests to this
framework. If you're interested please contact me - see https://github.com/jrbayliss for my contact details.
